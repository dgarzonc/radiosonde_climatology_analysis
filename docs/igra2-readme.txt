I. OVERVIEW
------------------------------------------------------------------------


This file provides guidance for how to navigate the FTP directory for 
Integrated Global Radiosonde Archive (IGRA). It provides a brief overview of 
what is new in IGRA 2.2, step-by-step instructions for downloading desired data 
and metadata, and an explanation of the contents of the directory and 
all of its subdirectories.
The formats of the various types of files available are described in 
separate documents.


As of February 2023, IGRA 2.2 replaces IGRA 2.0 as NCEI's baseline 
upper-air dataset.


Send any feedback to the IGRA Team at ncei.igra@noaa.gov.

II. WHAT'S NEW IN IGRA 2.2
------------------------------------------------------------------------


Following is a summary of what is new and different in IGRA 2.2 compared to
IGRA 2.0.


  - The NCEI/NCEP GTS record in Traditional Alphanumeric Code (TAC) 
    has been augmented with reports received in the newer Binary Universal 
    Form for the Representation of meteorological data (BUFR). This allows 
    data in IGRA to remain up-to-date as an increasing number of 
    stations switch to transmitting radiosonde reports via the Global 
    Telecommunication System (GTS). BUFR reports collected at the National 
    Weather Service's Telecommunications Gateway (NWSTG) and at 
    the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) 
    have been added as supplemental sources to the TAC GTS for each 
    station-day for which no TAC GTS reports are available and either
    NWSTG or ECMWF data are available. The filled-in soundings
    have been down-sampled from the typically high resolution of native 
    BUFR reports to the standard and significant levels that are consistent 
    with the historical record. For additional details, see the IGRA 
    Product Description Document located in the same folder as this 
    readme file. 


  - The previous Dataset Description (igra2-dataset-description.pdf) has 
    been reworked into a high-level Product Description 
    (igra2-product-description.pdf) and more detailed Product Description 
    Supplement (igra2-product-description-supplement.pdf).


  - IGRA data can now be accessed in two ways. FTP access continues to be 
    available at https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/pub/data/igra/ 
    (see Section IV below for the file structure). 
    It is best used from Linux consoles or FTP clients as an increasing 
    number of browsers do not support access to FTP. An alternate 
    direct-download        location that also works within browsers can be found 
    in the web-accessible folder at 
    https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/data/integrated-global-radiosonde-archive/ (see 
    Section V below). 


  - No changes have been made to the directory structure, file names, 
    or file formats.




------------------------------------------------------------------------
III. DOWNLOAD QUICK START
------------------------------------------------------------------------


Start by downloading "igra2-station-list.txt", which has metadata for all stations
in the dataset. You can find this file in the same location where you found this README
file. See the next two sections for details on file locations.


Then, to find and download the data for a specific station, proceed
as follows:


  - Find the station's name in "igra2-station-list.txt" and note its station
    identification code (e.g., Key West is "USM00072201").


  - Decide which of the following types of data you desire, navigate
    to the appropriate subdirectory, and download the desired 
    ZIP-compressed data file(s) and associated format documentation. 


    For individual soundings for the full period of record, go to
      subdirectory data-por and download the file containing the desired
     station ID in its filename (e.g., USM00072201-data.txt).
   For individual soundings from this year only, go to the data-y2d/ subdirectory and
     download the file containing the desired station ID in its filename.
   For period-of-record sounding-derived moisture, stability, and other 
     parameters, go to subdirectory derived-por/ and download the file whose name
     contains the desired station ID (e.g., USM00072201-drvd.txt).
   For monthly means for the full period of record, go to subdirectory 
     monthly-por/ download the file(s) for the desired variable and 
     nominal hour (e.g., temp_00z-mly.txt.zip for 0000 UTC temperature).
   For monthly means for only the last calendar month, go to 
     monthly-upd/ and download the file(s) for the desired variable 
     and nominal hour.
  
  - Uncompress the downloaded file using an uncompressing software (e.g., 
    7-Zip or winzip under Windows or the "gunzip" command under Linux).
